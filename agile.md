# Agile Breakdown of App Development

## App Concept
Give historical researchers the ability to search text in poorly-scanned historical documents (e.g. half-faded, multi-column layouts). 

The app must accurately capture all the text in the document (even if poorly preserved) and output the same document with searchable text (either through layering or re-embedding) so the user can search the *original* document.

## Persona

Title: Theology/History PhD Student
Name: James Manchester
32 years old
Male
Married
Has an MA in Theology from AU/SAU
Completing a Theology PhD

James is a hard-working theology student at Andrews University.

Goals:
- Read/review through thousands of historical documents
- Write a dissertation that is historically rigorous and accurate
- Spend time with family

Tasks:
- Spend lots of time reading
- Search and parse through hundreds of thousands of documents searching for relevant material
- Compile and annotate relevant quotes and historical documents
- Write up a cohesive dissertation while keeping all documents straight

James is not very adept at technology. He knows how to check email, do searches in archives, etc., but is completely unfamiliar with software engineering or anything more complicated than Scrivener.

He owns a Mac and an iPhone, but does his main research work on his Mac with either built-in tools or web ones.

## Scenarios



What does the user need? What kind of experience does our solution create? Does our solution work?" 

AI also reconstruct sentences that seem confusing?
